# Coffe-Machine-Project
Asks the user for the type of coffee they want and checks the available resources. If resources such as water, milk, cream and coffee are not enough, the program will inform the user about it and allow them to choose another type of coffee. If available, the program will ask you to enter coins. He counts the coins and returns the excess money, and adds the price of the coffee body to the money in the base. After each successful transaction, it renews the resources by deducting the used water / milk / cream / coffee, adding the money received, and giving us all the information at the end of the program.
